                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Click & Sip, your number one source for all things coffee. 
                        We're dedicated to giving you the very best of coffee, with a focus on quality, 
                        customer service, and uniqueness.</p>
                    <img src="/src/assets/about-us.jpg" alt="About Us Image" class="about-us-image">
                    <p>Founded in 2025 by Al Layug, Click & Sip has come a long way from its beginnings 
                        in a home office. When Al first started out, his passion for "eco-friendly coffee" 
                        drove him to quit his day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and 
                        inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world, 
                        and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly wing of the coffee industry.</p>
                    <p>At Click & Sip, we believe that coffee is more than just a beverage; it's a way of life.
                        Our mission is to provide our customers with the highest quality coffee, sourced from 
                        sustainable farms around the world. We are committed to environmentally friendly practices 
                        and strive to make a positive impact on the communities we work with.</p>
                    <p>Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a coffee experience that is both 
                        exceptional and accessible. We started by sourcing the finest beans and perfecting 
                        our roasting techniques. Over time, we expanded our product line to include a variety 
                        of blends and single-origin coffees, each with its own unique flavor profile.</p>
                    <p>Today, Click & Sip is proud to be a trusted name in the coffee industry. 
                        Our customers appreciate our dedication to quality and our commitment to sustainability. 
                        We are constantly innovating and exploring new ways to enhance the coffee experience, 
                        from our carefully curated selection of beans to our user-friendly online store.</p>
